# 🌦️ Weather Data Analysis using Python

This project analyzes weather data to understand temperature, humidity, wind, and precipitation trends over time.  
All analysis was performed in **Jupyter Notebook** using **Python libraries** like `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`.

## 📘 Project Overview
The main objective of this project is to explore how weather parameters such as **temperature**, **humidity**, **wind speed**, **visibility**, and **pressure** change with different conditions (rainy, cloudy, or clear days).  
The goal is to identify seasonal patterns and correlations between these factors for better understanding and forecasting.

## 🎯 Objectives
1. **Temperature Variation Analysis** — Examine how temperature and apparent temperature change over time.  
2. **Humidity & Temperature Relationship** — Study how humidity levels affect comfort and temperature.  
3. **Impact of Wind & Visibility** — Determine how wind and visibility vary across weather types.  
4. **Pressure & Precipitation Correlation** — Analyze how atmospheric pressure influences rainfall or snowfall.  
5. **Weather Pattern Detection** — Identify the most frequent weather summaries and their seasonal behavior.

## 🧹 Data Preprocessing
- Removed missing and duplicate values.  
- Corrected date formats.  
- Handled outliers in temperature and humidity.  
- Converted all units into standard formats (°C, km/h, etc.).

## 📊 Key Analysis & Insights
| No. | Question | Visualization Used | Key Insight |
| --- | -------- | ------------------ | ------------ |
| 1 | What are the basic statistics of the dataset? | Summary table | Most columns have balanced values — no major issues. |
| 2 | What is the average temperature? | Simple number/stat | The average temperature shows a mild climate trend. |
| 3 | How many times did each weather condition occur? | Bar chart | Rain is most common, followed by Clear weather. |
| 4 | How does temperature change over time? | Line chart | Temperature rises in summer and falls in winter. |
| 5 | What is the relationship between humidity and temperature? | Scatter plot | Hotter days tend to have lower humidity. |
| 6 | How does wind speed affect temperature? | Scatter plot | Wind speed shows no strong relation with temperature. |
| 7 | What is the distribution of temperature values? | Histogram | Most days fall within a normal temperature range. |
| 8 | Correlation between temperature and apparent temperature | Scatter plot | Very strong correlation — both rise and fall together. |
| 9 | Which month had the highest temperature? | Line chart | June–August are warmest; Dec–Feb are coolest. |
| 10 | How does humidity vary with precipitation type? | Box plot | Rainy/snowy days have higher humidity than clear days. |

## 🧠 Conclusions
- Weather data is clean and reliable.  
- **Rain** is the most frequent precipitation type.  
- **Temperature and apparent temperature** are highly correlated.  
- Clear seasonal patterns observed — **hot summers, cool winters**.  
- **Humidity** behaves predictably, higher during rainy periods.
